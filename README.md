# Hi there 👋
Welcome to my profile. I'm currently a student in the Warsaw university of technology, studying for a Bachelors in computer science: specialization in computer systems and networks, and this is my personal profile which I use to store all projects and other collaborative efforts which I have either independently done or simply participated in for future reference (you're welcome to have a look around!).

# Who am I? 🤔
My name is Mahmoud Elshekh Ali. I'm a 22 year old Palestinian student currently studying in Warsaw, Poland. I'm thoroughly interested in programming, computer and information science, data science, computer engineering, mathematics, and the field of IT and tech in general. I hope to get into as much of this very vast and ever expanding field as possible in my personal and professional life, and I hope to meet as many people as I can in my journey. I consider myself to be very open and friendly, so please contact me if you have a desire to or if you have any questions. My hobbies include reading, listening to music, playing videogames, and hanging out with friends.

# What's next? 🤷‍♂️
I'm looking towards developing my professional career through any opportunities that present themselves. I'm presently seeking interships and part time work, as my studies dont allow for more than that. If you are able to provide such opportunities, and what you've seen so far has interested you, then please contact me through the following:
